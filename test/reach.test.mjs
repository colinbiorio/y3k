// THE REACH — the synthetic pointer bus. Run: node test/reach.test.mjs
//
// reach.js needs a DOM to exercise, so what is held here is every invariant the
// module promises that is visible in its source. They are not style points: an
// adversarial review of the first version found all of these as real defects,
// and each of them fails silently — the room stuck spinning, a button firing
// twice a second, two hands sharing one pointer.
